Jellyfin Mobile is an Android app that connects to Jellyfin instances and integrates with the [official web client](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web).
We welcome all contributions and pull requests! If you have a larger feature in mind please open an issue so we can discuss the implementation before you start.
Even though the client is only a web wrapper there are still lots of improvements and bug fixes that can be accomplished with Android and Kotlin knowledge.

Most of the translations can be found in the [web client](https://translate.jellyfin.org/projects/jellyfin/jellyfin-web) since it's the base for the Android client as well. Translations for the app can also be improved very easily from our [Weblate](https://translate.jellyfin.org/projects/jellyfin-android/jellyfin-android) instance. Look through the following graphic to see if your native language could use some work!

This client was rewritten from scratch with a fresh git history in July to August 2020, and replaces the old Cordova-based client,
which can still be found [in the archives](https://github.com/jellyfin-archive/jellyfin-android-original).

## Build Process

### Dependencies

- Android SDK

### Build

1. Clone or download this repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-android.git
   cd jellyfin-android
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio and run it from there or build an APK directly through Gradle:

   ```sh
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

### Deploy to device/emulator

   ```sh
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

*You can also replace the "Debug" with "Release" to get an optimized release binary.*

## Release Flavors

There are two flavors (variants) of the Jellyfin Android app:

- The **proprietary** version comes with Google Chromecast support
- The **libre** version comes without Google Chromecast support

The proprietary version is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jellyfin.mobile) and the [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B081RFTTQ9), while the libre version is available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jellyfin.mobile/).
Additionally, `beta` releases exist for both flavors, but only the proprietary version is published to a beta track on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jellyfin.mobile).
If you'd like to test the beta outside of Google Play, you can simply download it from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-android/releases/latest).
